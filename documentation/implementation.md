# Implementation Document

## Architecture

`src/interface/mod.rs` defines high level interfaces used to implement the algorithm
`src/wave_function_collapse` includes the actual implementation

## Time complexity

Worst case time complexity should be analyzed. Practical testing suggests that the base algorithm (without backtracking) has been implemented with **quadratic** average time complexity.

## Memory complexity
